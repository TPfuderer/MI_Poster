Tree-based Multiple Imputation methods:
MI methods based on machine learning algorithms (see e.g. Burgette &
Reiter 2010) have become increasingly popular, although they are not
considered proper MI methods
Objectives:

(a) Describe and discuss the miceranger algorithm. Compare methods
from the miceranger package with methods ’pmm’ and ’cart’ in mice.
Conduct a simulation study and investigate the ’properness’ of these
methods by focusing on diagnostics for multivariate model parame-
ters.
[Packages and vignettes available. Requires implementation of an MC
study.]

**GOAL OF PAPER: investigate the ’properness’ of methods with diagnostics for multivariate model parameters.**

**Secondary (optional): When to use which method?** 

Create outline for showing properness in MC simulation study.
